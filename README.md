# Analyzing movie genres
This project earned grade 5 in the advanced course Text Mining (TDDE16) at Link√∂ping University.

The purpose of the project was to study a text mining approach to predict movie genres based on the content of the movie's script. Since a movie can have multiple genres, the task was a Multiclass Classification. Therefore, both macro and micro accuracy were used, achieving 82% and 11.6% accuracy respectively.

In the end, the small amount of scripts was the model's primary downfall. The scripts were gathered from the Internet Script Movie Database (IMSDb).
